# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2, completed as part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Dev Bootcamp curriculum.

After inheriting an [existing code-base](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/jungle-rails/), the following features were implemented:

## Features:

* **Sold Out Badge**: displayed when a product has 0 quantity
* **Admin Categories**: admin users can list and create new categories
* **User Authentication**: registration, login, and logout functionality
* **Order Details**: each order page displays the items of the order, quantities, line item totals, and total order amount
* **Email Receipt**: email sent upon order creation
* **Admin Security**: users must enter HTTP authentication login and password details to access admin pages
* **Product Reviews**: all users can view product ratings and logged in users can leave reviews.
